py_llvm_compile is a small experiment to allow defining and invoking
native functions in python.

In order to use it, you should have a developer setup of LLVM
(download sources for LLVM 3.1 from llvm.org, compile and install) and
llvmpy (http://www.llvmpy.org/).

This package currently has no documentation, but the few examples
(provided as tests) in the code.
